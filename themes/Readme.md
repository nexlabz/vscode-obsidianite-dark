### VS Code Theme: Obsidianite

## I love the Obsidianite theme made for the Obsidian notetaking app. I decided to try to port as much of the style of that as I could over to VS code.

## Installation
To easily install via github run the following.

```
code --install-extension https://github.com/yourname/vscode-obsidianite-dark/releases/download/v1.0.0/obsidianite-dark-1.0.0.vsix
```

You can also clone the repo and run on your local machine using the following (make sure to point to the correct location to the vsix file.)

```
code --install-extension obsidianite-dark-1.0.0.vsix
```

## Inspiration

This VS Code theme is heavily inspired by the amazing [Obsidianite theme for Obsidian](https://github.com/bennyxguo/Obsidian-Obsidianite) created by [@bennyxguo](https://github.com/bennyxguo).

All credit for the original color palette and design goes to them.


# Obsidianite Dark â€“ VS Code Theme

A dark, neon-inspired Visual Studio Code theme based on the [Obsidianite](https://github.com/bennyxguo/Obsidian-Obsidianite) theme for the Obsidian note-taking app.

I loved the look and feel of Obsidianite so much that I ported its color palette and style into VS Code as a full theme.

## ðŸ§ª Notes

Best enjoyed with the Rubik font or Operator Mono.
Italics and color styles are optimized for that smooth, Obsidianite feel.
